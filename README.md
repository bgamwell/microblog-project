***About***

"Clever Captions" is a one-page Web application that allows users to come up with a "clever" caption for a randomly-generated picture (this version will not incorporate randomly generated pictures, but will display a static picture which users can comment on). Others can comment on users' captions with suggestions and opinions--but oh no! It looks as if a troll has been set loose on the site!
